Burp Suite

Framework is a framework writeen in java that aims to provide a one-stop-shop for web application penetration testing. Also used when accessing mobile applicatins, as the same features which is so attractive for web app testing translate almost perfectly into testing the APIs.

The abaility to intercept, view and modify web request prior to them being sent to the target server, makes burp suite perfect fot any kind of manual web app testing.

Proxy:
	Well-known aspet of burp suite, allows us to intercept and modify request/response when interacting with web application

Repeater:
	Allows su to capture, modify, then resend the same request numerous time. This feature can be absolutley invaluable, espically when we neef to craft a payload through trial and error or when testing the functionaliy of a endpoint for flaws.

Intruder:
	allows us to spray an endpoint with request. This is often used for bruteforce attacks or to fuzz end points.

Decoder: 
	provides valuable service when trasforming data --either in terms of deoding captured information, or enoding a payload prior to sending it to the target. 

Comparer:
	allows us to compare two pieces of data at either word or byte level. 

Sequencer:
	sequence is used when accessing the randomness of tokens such as cookie values or other supposedly random generated data.
